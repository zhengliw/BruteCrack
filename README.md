# BruteCrack
A small and extremely lightweight tool to list brute-force cracked passwords.

# What is this?
BruteCrack should list passwords using Brute Force.

# What to pay A LOT of attention for?

Do not use this for illegal hacking. I warned you. This is designed for pen-testing inside of a private network.

# How does it work?

Check out the code yourself!

# Where are the changelogs etc?

They're all in the folders inside of /BruteCrack/.

# And now, enjoy BruteCrack!

By the way, keep this repos as funny and enjoyable (sorry I don't speak English, well yes but no) as possible! And now just enjoy your stay!
