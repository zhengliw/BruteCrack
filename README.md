# BruteCrack

A small and extremely lightweight tool to list brute-force cracked passwords.

# What is this?

BruteCrack should list passwords using Brute Force. More features will be introduced during updates!

# What to pay A LOT of attention for?

Do not use this for illegal hacking. I warned you. This is designed for pen-testing inside of a private network.
But I won't stop you entirely from doing this, since it doesn't match the philosophy of Linux and all that stuff...
Still, I DO NOT TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR LEGAL PENALTIES!!! Don't use my tool, get away black-hats...

# How does it work?

Check out the code yourself!

# Where are the changelogs etc?

They're all in the folders inside of /BruteCrack/.

# And now, enjoy BruteCrack!

By the way, keep this repos as funny and enjoyable (sorry I don't speak English, well yes but no) as possible! And now just enjoy your stay!
